# WV-Flood-Attendance-Analysis-R

While the financial impact natural disasters is well-documented, I felt there was a gap in understanding the broader, non-market effects. I wanted to explore these less tangible consequences, so I chose to stufy how flooding in West Virginia, a flood-prone state, affects school attendance. This project aims to shed light on these often overlooked impacts.
